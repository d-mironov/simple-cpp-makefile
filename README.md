# Simple C++ Makefile Project

This is a very simple C++ Makefile project that can be used as a template.

## Usage
`make`/`make all`: Builds all `.cpp` files and compiles a binary to `./output`.
`make run`: Builds with `make all` and runs the binary located int `./output`.
`make clean`: Removes the `build` directory where the binary and all the `.o` (object files) are located.
